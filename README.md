# DigitalStoreAnalysis
The aim of this project is to examine how we can make appropriate business decisions to potentially maximise our sales by analysing our data using SQL. We will be using [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite), a relational database management system (RMDBS).

We will be using a database from a digital media store similar to the iTunes Library. It contains several tables which stores information of customers, invoices, artists, albums, and tracks from its store.

**Edit:** To attest to my striving of improvement, my HackerRank certificates are attached below. The SQL Advanced Certificate is not available as of yet in HackerRank.
