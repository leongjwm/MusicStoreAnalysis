# MusicStoreAnalysis
The goal of this project is to examine how we can make appropriate business decisions to potentially maximise sales in a digital media store, using SQL.

The dataset is a modified version of a sample dataset from the iTunes Library, where the dataset is meant to imitate the data collected from a digital media store.
